# Bugfix Problem Instructions

There is a file called FixMe.tsx that defines a simple React component, plus a corresponding test file FixMe.test.tsx. The component has several bugs in it which are causing the test suite to fail. Your job is to edit FixMe.tsx to correct the bug so that the tests pass.

1. After cloning the repo, checkout a new feature branch.
2. Fix the bugs in FixMe.tsx.
3. Once the tests are passing, create a pull request from your branch for us to review.
