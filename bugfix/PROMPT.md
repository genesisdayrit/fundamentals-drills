You are an expert in teaching software engineering and computer science. I am creating a test for software engineers and need your assistance. One section of this test involves a debugging task in TypeScript. Please create an exercise that meets the following criteria:

- The code to debug should be approximately 80-100 lines and located in a file at `bugfix/src/bugfix.ts`. Use `eslint` and/or `prettier` to make sure that you're not going too far over this line count after readability whitespace is added.
- The file should contain one function with 5 bugs in it.
- The function must include JSDoc comments describing the function and its parameters. Other than that, there are 0 comments in bugfix.ts. ZERO. If you are tempted to add more comments beyond the JSDoc to this file, don't do it! If bugfix.ts contains the string "// BUG" or any variation, you failed.
- After you generate bugfix.ts, do a second pass over it an remove any comments similar to "// BUG".
- Do not include any advanced data structures and algorithms concepts. E.g., no depth-first search, no dynamic programming, no regular expressions.
- Provide a unit test suite that is thorough but initially fails. The test suite should be located in a file at `bugfix/tests/bugfix.test.ts`. Make sure to run `bun test` on this file to ensure that all the tests pass, and adjust whatever code is needed to fix them.
- Provide a file at `bugfix/src/bugfix_solution.ts` which is the same as bugfix.ts but has all of the bugs fixed. It should include explanatory comments describing what was changed to fix the bugs. If you do not include these explanatory comments, you failed the task.

The test-taker will pass the test by fixing the bugs in `bugfix.ts` so that the test suite passes successfully.
