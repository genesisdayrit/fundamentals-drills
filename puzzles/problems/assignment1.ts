/*
 * Library Book Tracker
 *
 * You are managing a library system that tracks which books are checked out by patrons.
 * Given a list of checkout records, find the patron who has checked out the most books.
 * In case of a tie, return the patron whose name comes first alphabetically.
 *
 * Input: Array of checkout records, where each record has { patron: string, book: string }
 * Output: The name of the patron with the most checkouts (string)
 *
 * Examples:
 * - [{ patron: "Alice", book: "1984" }, { patron: "Bob", book: "Dune" }, { patron: "Alice", book: "Brave New World" }] → "Alice"
 * - [{ patron: "Charlie", book: "Foundation" }, { patron: "Bob", book: "Neuromancer" }] → "Bob" (alphabetical tie-breaker)
