/**
 * Assignment 1 — Consecutive Sum Streak
 *
 * Context:
 * In analytics or signal processing, we sometimes want to detect “streaks” of rising data. Given an array of integers,
 * return the length of the longest consecutive increasing run (where each next number is exactly 1 greater).
 * For example, [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10] has a longest streak [5,6,7,8] of length 4.
 *
 * Input:
 *   - nums: number[] — may be empty or contain duplicates.
 * Output:
 *   - number — length of the longest strictly consecutive +1 run.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   longestStreak([1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10]) -> 4
 *   longestStreak([5,5,5]) -> 1
 *   longestStreak([]) -> 0
