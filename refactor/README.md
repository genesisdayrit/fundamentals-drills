# Bugfix

## Assignment

This assignment is defined in a file called `RefactorMe.tsx`. It contains a single React component that works, but is poorly factored (i.e., contains repeated code, is difficult to read and to extend, etc.). Your job is to refactor the component to resolve these issues while ensuring that the tests in `RefactorMe.test.tsx` continue pass and the component retains the same look and feel.

You can run it with `bun dev` in the root directory. You can run the tests with `bun test-refactor`.

## Definition of "Done"

The refactored code is clean and compiles, the tests pass, and the component still has the same behavior and appearance.
