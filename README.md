# Fundamentals Drills

**Goal:**
This week is about proving you can perform the core engineering movements without relying on AI. Once you demonstrate mastery across all four drills, you’ll unlock AI for the rest of the program.

## The Four Drills

### 1. Bug Fix (TypeScript) (25 minutes)

A small React app with broken behavior or setup. Your task is to diagnose and repair it so that it behaves as intended and all tests pass.
**Focus:** Debugging, reading unfamiliar code, understanding component state and props.

### 2. Refactor (React) (25 minutes)

A functioning React app that’s written poorly—confusing names, repeated logic, messy structure. Your goal is to refactor it without changing its behavior.
**Focus:** Abstraction, clarity, and improving existing codebases.

### 3. Programming Puzzle (TypeScript) (25 minutes)

A pair of small problems designed to test your fundamentals with TypeScript and data manipulation.
**Focus:** Writing small, pure functions and reasoning about data flow.

### 4. System Design (25 minutes)

A short design exercise modeled after industry design documents. You’ll outline data models, key components, and request flows.
**Focus:** Thinking in systems, modeling data, and explaining design choices.

## Daily Flow

- Each morning, you’ll receive a new set of variants for all four drills.
- You’ll have **100 minutes total** to work through them.
- Submit your work as a pull request for that day’s branch.
- When you pass a drill emphatically, you no longer need to repeat it on later days.
- If you don’t pass, train on that area using the provided materials and return to it the next day.

## Passing Rules

- Passing means your work is clearly correct and shows confidence, not just that it “sort of works.” We will tell you when you've done this.
- Once you pass a drill, you’re done with it for the rest of the week.
- Failing a drill means you’ll need to train on that skill before attempting the next day’s variant.
- There are no same-day retries. Each new day brings a fresh version of the drills.

## After Passing All Drills

Once you’ve demonstrated strong fundamentals across all four areas, you unlock the use of AI tools for the remainder of the week. At that point, you’ll shift from isolated skill training to full AI-assisted engineering practice.
