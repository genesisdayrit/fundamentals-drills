# Objective

Design a minimal Etsy shop with the following features:
 - Storefront displaying all products on sale
 - Ability to buy products (no need to build payments integation for this exercise; just remove the item from the database when "bought")
 - Store admin can manually add more products

## 1. Core User Flows
For each flow, describe what happens end-to-end with bullet points. For the Twitter question, this might be:
- Follow someone
- Create a post
- Load the home timeline

Focus on the path of a request and what data is read or written.

 ## 2. Data models
List your tables and columns, with primary keys and any unique constraints or indexes you need for V1. Include 1â€“2 example rows where helpful.

## 3. Architecture Diagram
Attach a simple boxes-and-arrows diagram showing client, API server, and database. Label arrows with the main requests (e.g., "POST /follow", "GET /timeline"). Keep it legible and minimal.

## 4. API Sketch
List the minimal endpoints and their request/response shapes at a high level. Keep this terse.

For twitter:
- `POST /follow`
- `POST /posts`
- `GET /timeline`

State what each returns on success and what errors matter in V1.
