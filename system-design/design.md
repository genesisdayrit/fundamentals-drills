# Objective

Design a minimal Twitter with three capabilities:
 - Follow another user
 - Post a short message
 - Read a home timeline showing the latest posts from people you follow

 ## 1. Overview
Describe the product slice you are building. What can a user do in V1, and what is explicitly out of scope? In 4–6 sentences, explain the overall shape of the system (client → API → database) and how data moves through it at a high level.

## 2. Architecture Diagram
Attach a simple boxes-and-arrows diagram showing client, API server, and database. Label arrows with the main requests (e.g., "POST /follow", "GET /timeline"). Keep it legible and minimal.

## 3. Core User Flows
For each flow, describe what happens end-to-end in a few short paragraphs. For the Twitter question, this might be:
- Follow someone
- Create a post
- Load the home timeline

Focus on the path of a request and what data is read or written.

## 4. Data Models
List your tables and columns, with primary keys and any unique constraints or indexes you need for V1. Include 1–2 example rows where helpful.

## 5. API Sketch
List the minimal endpoints and their request/response shapes at a high level. Keep this terse.

- `POST /follow`
- `POST /posts`
- `GET /timeline`

State what each returns on success and what errors matter in V1.
